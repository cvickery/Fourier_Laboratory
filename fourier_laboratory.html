<h1>FFT Laboratory Help</h1>

<h2>Introduction</h2>

  <p>This application helps you visualize two different aspects of
  Fourier analysis:</p>
  
  <ol>

    <li>How a complex waveform can be decomposed into the sum of
    simple sinusoids.  It does this backwards: instead of
    <em>analyzing</em> an existing waveform, you use the program to
    <em>generate</em> a waveform by mixing sinusoids.</li>

    <li>How various sampling parameters affect the result of applying
     an FFT analysis on a complex waveform you have generated.</li>

  </ol>

<h2>Procedure</h2>

  <h3>Construct a waveform from component sinusoids</h3>

    <p>Initially, there is a single sinusoid, a sine wave with a
    frequency of 440 Hz, displayed.  There are three controls for this
    wave on the right side of the window, which you can use to change
    its frequency, phase, and amplitude.  As you manipulate these
    controls, you will see their effects on the composite waveform in
    the top left panel and in the FFT waveform in the bottom left
    panel.</p>

  	<p>Each time you click "Add a New Signal Component," another
  	 sinusoid is added to the composite signal, and you can manipulate
  	 its frequency, phase, and amplitude using the controls provided
  	 for it.</p>
  	
    <p>Each component signal also has buttons you can click to change:
    <ul>
      <li>The color used to draw that component in the composite signal</li>
      <li>Whether to draw the shape of that component in the composite
          signal or not</li>
      <li>Whether to include that component in the calculation of the
          composite signal or not</li>
      <li>To delete that component completely from the program</li>
    </ul>
    </p>

  <h3>Set the sampling parameters</h3>
    
    <p>You can use the controls below the time domain waveform display
    to zoom or pan the waveform and to set various viewing options for
    it.  If you mouse over the waveform, the coordinates of the mouse
    cursor will show numerical values of the points in the window.
    Click in this panel to turn this display on and off.  The number of
    components and maximum amplitude of the composite waveform are
    also displayed; they can be dragged around the window if they
    obscure something you want to be able to see, and they will be
    hidden if you click the mouse.</p>
  	
    <p>The controls below the time domain waveform display also let
    you adjust the following sampling parameters:</p>

    <ul>

      <li>Sample rate in samples per second.  If you set this value to
      less than twice the frequency of the highest frequency
      sinusoidal component, the program displays a message warning you
      that the rate is less than the Nyquist frequency, and the FFT
      will not capture the highest frequency component(s)
      accurately.</li>
  		
      <li>Bits per sample.  This parameter determines how accurately
      the sample values approximate the waveform being sampled.  If
      you choose the view samples option, you will be able to see the
      effect of this parameter in the waveform.

    </ul>
  	
    <h3>Set the FFT calculation parameters</h3>

      <p>The panel in the lower left corner displays the frequency
      analysis of the waveform you generated in the time domain.
      <em>The FFT calculation to produce this analysis is not correct,
      and the display only "sort of"; represents the frequency domain
      at this time.</em></p>

  <h2>Saving Samples</h2>

  <p>At any time, you can save the set of samples along with the
  sampling parameters (sample rate, bits per sample, number of
  samples) in a text file.  By default, each parameter value and each
  sample value is saved as a single numeric line of text.  If you
  select "Save Samples As M-file" from the Option menu, you can save
  the information as a MatLab M-file.  If you then run this file from
  within MatLab (type the file name without the ".m" extension),
  MatLab variables will be initialized with the parameter and sample
  values, and MatLab will plot the frequency domain representation of
  the signal.</p>
